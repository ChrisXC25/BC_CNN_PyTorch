Create a CNN model for breast cancer image classification

Here, we will use the kaggle breast histopathological images (Invasive Ductal Carcinoma) as inputs to train a simple CNN model for a binary classification task (IDC_positive vs IDC_negative)

## Create a simple Convolutional Neural Networks to classify breast cancer status (IDC)

- Download and load IDC data
- Create train and test set in PyTorch format
- Construct a simple CNN model
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model performances

### Download Breast Histopathology Images
